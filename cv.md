## üìù Summary
Graduated from programming courses "TeachMeSkills". On my graduation project, I developed a weather forecast application. In the project I used React, Redux (thunk), i18next, mapbox-gl libraries. Tools such as Proxy-Object, Promise.all Settled, localStorage (when the page is reloaded, the selected temperature unit and language are saved). During the initial upload, the location is determined using the Geolocation API. The weather is displayed for today (updated once an hour) and for the next 3 days. I also deployed the application on a clean Ubuntu server with subsequent manual configuration, domain connection and SSL certificate using the Cloudflare service.

After completing the courses, I realized that I felt insecure about creating Vanilla Javascript applications and decided to take free, but high-quality courses from The Rolling Scopes School. I have now completed stage #0 of JS/FE Pre-School and am determined to strengthen and develop my programming skills at stage#1 of JavaScript/Front-end.

Objective ‚Äî starting my career as a Junior Front-End developer.

## ‚úî Skills
* HTML 5, CSS3 
* SASS / SCSS
* JavaScript
* React, Redux (thunk), React-Router
* Node.js
* Webpack
* GIT

## üíæ Example of My Code
JSX (Icon component with Proxy-object)
```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { ReactComponent as RefreshBgIcon } from '../../assets/icons/refresh.svg';
import { ReactComponent as ThunderstormRainIcon } from '../../assets/icons/weather/tstorm.svg';
import { ReactComponent as ThunderstormDrizzleIcon } from '../../assets/icons/weather/tstormdrizzle.svg';
import { ReactComponent as FlurriesDayIcon } from '../../assets/icons/weather/flurriesd.svg';
import { ReactComponent as FlurriesNightIcon } from '../../assets/icons/weather/flurriesn.svg';
import { ReactComponent as RainIcon } from '../../assets/icons/weather/rain.svg';
import { ReactComponent as DefaultWeatherIcon } from '../../assets/icons/weather/default.svg';

let TypeToIconMap = {
  refreshBg: <RefreshBgIcon />,
  thunderstormRain: <ThunderstormRainIcon />,
  thunderstormDrizzle: <ThunderstormDrizzleIcon />,
  flurriesDay: <FlurriesDayIcon />,
  flurriesNight: <FlurriesNightIcon />,
  rain: <RainIcon />,
};

TypeToIconMap = new Proxy(TypeToIconMap, {
  get: (target, type) => {
    if (type in target) {
      return target[type];
    }

    return <DefaultWeatherIcon />;
  },
});

const Icon = ({ type }) => TypeToIconMap[type];

Icon.propTypes = { type: PropTypes.string };

Icon.defaultProps = { type: '' };

export default Icon;
```

| 2021 ‚Äî 2022 (3 months) | **Front-end Developer (stage#0)** <br> **The Rolling Scopes School** <br> - Development using HTML5 and CSS3 <br> - Development using Vanilla Javascript <br> **Projects within the framework of teaching at The Rolling Scopes School (stage#0):** <br> 1. Developed a CV in two types (Markdown & Git and HTML, CSS & Git Basics). ([code](https://motya22.github.io/rsschool-cv/)) <br> 2. Adaptive Portfolio layout with added functionality. Valid, semantic layout. Interactivity implemented through css. Adaptability is implemented using media queries, css variables, burger menu. From the functionality, the change of images in the portfolio section, the translation of the page into two languages, the ability to switch light and dark themes has been added. ([code](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/motya22-JSFEPRESCHOOL/portfolio/)) <br> 3. Developed a custom video player. To create a player whose design meets the requirements, I used JavaScript (an HTMLMediaElement object). ([code](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/motya22-JSFEPRESCHOOL/portfolio/#video)) <br> 4. Developed a video search engine. To process asynchronous code, I used Promise &
Async/await. I used TMDB as an API. ([code](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/motya22-JSFEPRESCHOOL/movie-app/)) <br> 5. Developed the game Whack a Mole. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in time. The last ten results are displayed in the table and saved when you restart.
